processes should be documented.

identification document is presented.

stated in account closure instructions are applied.
- If the request to freeze the account of an expatriate is made after his final exit from

bank. Banks are not allowed to transfer only part of the balance. The balance shall
only be transferred abroad to the account holder or the legal agent of his/her heirs
upon the approval of the compliance department.
- In case an expatriate customer requests the bank to transfer the balance of his/her
account immediately after his/her previous final exit and presents a visa other than
the work visa, the balance exceeding SAR (50,000) may only be paid upon the
approval of the compliance department after evaluating the account. If such a
customer directly applies to the bank and submits a new Iqama issued under the
same passport or a new passport, the frozen account shall be closed if it is still within
the freezing duration, before (180) days, and a new account shall be opened for
him/her and the amount shall be transferred to the new account, and thereafter
he/she shall be allowed to deal on such account.

obligations are allowed to continue after the freezing of the account subject to the
approval of the operation manager at the bank's Head Office, for a limited number

address, financial information including personal information of the customer’s
13

commercial entity’s board of directors;
- The customer's behavior in executing financial transactions on the account
has changed.

calendar years from the date of the last financial transaction carried out by the

accounts active, save the customer assets (money) that have not been used for recorded
debit transactions or documented correspondences during the period specified in
Article (5.2). The Rule also supports communicating with customers, returning the rights
14
to their owners upon request immediately after the completion of documents and
necessary procedures, changing account status to abandoned if banks are unable to
reach the account holder after using all methods of contact. Accounts of government
entities shall be excluded from the provisions of this Rule in respect of the phase of
abandoned accounts only as set forth in paragraph (5.2.4). Accounts of statutory reserve
deposited by financial institutions supervised by SAMA, whose balances are not allowed
to be disposed of without prior written permission from SAMA, shall also be excluded
from the provisions of this Rule.

5. Safe deposit boxes (lockers) rented by banks to customers with contracts that have
not been renewed from the date of the customer’s last visit, and banks were unable to
reach the owners by using direct contact or other methods of contact or checking the

deposit boxes shall be applicable.
6. Unpaid amounts and profits due to customers on their investments in different types
of investment funds managed, or was managed, or held by the bank for customers
whose investment periods have expired and their owners have not received the
amounts due because they do not visit the bank to receive such amounts and profits,

customer and the nature of his/her activities and transactions, prior to or during the
business relationship or the process of opening the account, or prior to carrying out
a transaction to a customer with whom it has no business relationship, by assessing

monitoring and information security and protection to continuously monitor
customers’ transactions.
- Banks shall continuously assess internal risk-based controls in order to benefit from
unusual activities that have been detected.
- The electronic systems used in banks should be suitable for the nature of the bank's

1. Digit number (1) on the left refers to the type of the computer number, and its value is as
follows:
-The value is (1) for Saudi citizens. When a Saudi citizen is born, he/she is given a computer
number (which is the number of his/her national ID). The computer number of an
establishment of a Saudi natural person is the number of the owner’s ID.
-The value is (2) for foreign residents of all nationalities. The computer number for a resident is
the same as that of his/her Iqama. Each foreign resident in Saudi Arabia has his/her own
unique number regardless of him/her being a family head or a dependent. The computer
number of an establishment of a foreign natural person permitted to own businesses is the
number of his/her Iqama.
-The value is (3) or (5) for visitors coming to Saudi Arabia for the purpose of a temporary visit
rather than residence, such as those coming for Umrah, on a special or business visit, etc. This
value is also used for GCC citizens. The computer number is given to a GCC citizen coming to
Saudi Arabia and is used in each visit to Saudi Arabia.
-The value is (6) for pilgrims. The number is given to a pilgrim upon his/her arrival in Saudi
Arabia to perform Hajj.
112
-The value is (7) for government entities, joint-stock companies, privet entities, or any other
entities, such as military missions, charities, international schools, sports clubs, or diplomatic
bodies, etc.
2. The value from digit number (2) to digit number (9) is a serial number ranging from 00000000
to 99999999.
3. Digit number (10) is a “verification" digit. Its value ranges from (0) to (9) and is derived from the
values of the other nine digits. It is used to check the correctness of the computer number. Any
entity wishing to receive the formula applied to derive this digit for programming purposes, may
contact the National Information Center of the Ministry of Interior..
